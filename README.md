# Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation** for evaluating machine learning models. Stratification ensures that each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset, which is especially important for imbalanced classification problems.
